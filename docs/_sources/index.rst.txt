Just as a reminder, I would like you to reflect about the fact that **$1.00 Dollar** might be **not**
that **much** to you, but **you, an incredible person**, combined to other's **amazing Sponsors**, can **finance** this
project, and it will **allows me** to constantly **improve and maintain** it, **and, I am not asking that much**.

Here is my Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/joaopeuko) link.

  - Yeah, I would like to do that, but I do not have that kind of money.

That is Ok, and, there are many ways you can help me, here is a list:

  - **Star** this project on GitHub.

  - **Open an account with Binance referral link**:

Summary:
========

- How to install::

In order to be able to use this Binance Spot module you will need a Binance API Key.

To create a Binance API you can follow the steps in Binance page:
https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072

.. code-block:: python

        # -----
        # Binance Spot

        BINANCE_API_KEY = <insert your credential here>

        # -----

After that, inside your project you will need a file .env. Click to create a new file, and when the name for the file is
asked type ".env" without "".
