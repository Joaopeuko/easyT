# easyT

- easyT,
  - easyTo trade,
    - easyTo use!

# Summary

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Libraries Documentation](#libraries-documentation)

# Requirements

The first thing tou will need is **Python** installed in your computer.
Right now, it is required the version 3.8.

- _Yeah, ok, but I do not know how to install Python on my computer, or I do not want to install it._
  - _Can I still use it?_

In parts, you can use Notebooks that allows you to use Python direct from the web, test the code and, understand how
things works before try it in your computer.
Two famous Notebooks are **Google Colaboratory** and **Jupyter Notebook**.

I will provide examples!

Remember that the use of an IDE can make your live easier, I use **PYCHARM**!

On your favorite IDE, you can use some project that you already have or create a new one, and then you install it:

```python
pip install easyT
```

That is it! The first steps are completed!

 - #### Q: What do I do now? How to use it?

Simple, type ```easyt``` on your terminal, and it will generate a ```demo.py``` file!
If you prefer, you can give to it a different name, just typing:

```easyt --file_name example``` generates:
```example.py```

```easyt --file_name test_file``` generates:
```test_file.py```
